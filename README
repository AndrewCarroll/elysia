This project is an attempt to bring a biological approach to AI. Our goal is to generate a framework that encompasses all of the meaningful properties of neurons (brain cells) and place them in an architecture where they have the greatest possible freedom to associate and evolve. Where similar attempts in the past have simplified many aspects of the biology, we believe that a complete representation of the important biology is essential to success.
